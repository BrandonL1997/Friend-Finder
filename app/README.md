in this assignment we created a app where you take a survey and based on the survey it'll give you a result of someone that should be your friend. 
i had a few problems in my javascript where once you press submit it doesn't do anything and it gives me an error in my console.
i also couldn't get my Heroku to connect i have a few errors. i' m posting images attached to my Readme to show the exact errors i had. And i'm gonna re submit this once i fix the errors
